abstract = {Abstract Physics simulation offers the possibility of truly responsive and realistic animation. Despite wide adoption of physics simulation for the animation of passive phenomena, such as fluids, cloths and rag‐doll characters, commercial applications still resort to kinematics‐based approaches for the animation of actively controlled characters. However, following a renewed interest in the use of physics simulation for interactive character animation, many recent publications demonstrate tremendous improvements in robustness, visual quality and usability. We present a structured review of over two decades of research on physics‐based character animation, as well as point out various open research areas and possible future directions.}

abstract = {Abstract Muscle-based control is transforming the field of physics-based character animation through the integration of knowledge from neuroscience, biomechanics and robotics, which enhance motion realism. Since any physics‐based animation system can be extended to a muscle‐actuated system, the possibilities of growth are tremendous. However, modelling muscles and their control remains a difficult challenge. We present an organized review of over a decade of research in muscle‐based control for character animation, its fundamental concepts and future directions for development. The core of this review contains a classification of control methods, tables summarizing their key aspects and popular neuromuscular functions used within these controllers, all with the purpose of providing the reader with an overview of the field.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper surveys the set of techniques developed in computer graphics for animating human walking. First we focus on the evolution from purely kinematic ‘knowledge‐based’ methods to approaches that incorporate dynamic constraints or use dynamic simulations to generate motion. Then we review the recent advances in motion editing that enable the control of complex animations by interactively blending and tuning synthetic or captured motions.
